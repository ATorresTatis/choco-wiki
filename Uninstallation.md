## Uninstalling Chocolatey

Should you decide you don't like chocolatey, you can uninstall it simply by removing the folder (and the user environment variable(s) that it creates).  Since it is not actually installed on your system, you don't have to worry that it cluttered up your registry.

User Environment Variables:
