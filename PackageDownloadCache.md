One of the longstanding things we have always wanted in the community feed was to remove the element of package breakages due to change/movement of download locations at their distribution point. We are now able to offer that in a private distribution to our licensed users! This is the "alternate **permanent** download location" feature we talked about in the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ferventcoder/chocolatey-the-alternative-windows-store-like-yum/description).

> Highlighting a few things:

> * **Pro/business only feed(s)** supporting packages that are only available to professional and above customers. 
> * Alternate **permanent** download location - A private location that contains the installers for most packages, removing the instability of downloads that are removed from their distribution point (or updated to newer versions).
> * **Virus checking during runtime.**

> The biggest features here are more **safety, trust and predictability**.


## FAQs
### Why can't you offer it publicly? 
Software distribution and legal reasons - the short of it is that we can't have a public archive of software out there. So we require a user to be licensed with a pro/business version to be able to take advantage of this capability.

### I'm a software vendor, should I be concerned about you caching my software files?
In short, you need not be concerned. We are offering private files to private users as a service. We are not modifying, selling, renting, leasing, lending, or sub-licensing these files. We are also not offering these files to the public in any way, shape, or form.

**NOTE**: If the software itself requires a license, users will still need to obtain that software license from the vendors. We do not try to hack it or make it free in any way. Licensed users get the original software, unmodified.

What we are doing is typically no different than what most organizations do when there is software publicly available on the internet. An organization would usually download all software that its constituents would use to an internal file share. We are doing the same thing for our licensed users, offering a private internal distribution just for them and not publicly. Because we don't modify the files in any way, under US law it means we are not violating any distribution rights because those files are not available publicly, only to private users that have obtained a license. We are simply caching a file that is publicly available for private use. We are governed under United States law concerning software distribution and make all attempts to comply.
