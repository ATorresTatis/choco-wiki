One of the longstanding things we have always wanted in the community feed was to remove the element of package breakages due to movement of files by software vendors. We are now able to offer that in a private distribution to our licensed users!

## FAQs
### Why can't you offer it publicly? 
Software distribution and legal reasons - the short of it is that we can't have a public archive of software out there. So we require a user to be licensed with a pro/business version to be able to take advantage of this capability.

### I'm a software vendor, should I be concerned about you caching my files?
In short, you do not need to be concerned. We are offering private files to private users.

What we are doing is no different than what most companies do when it comes to software. An organization would usually download all software that its constituents would use to an internal file share. We are doing the same thing for our licensed users, offering a private internal distribution just for them and not publicly. Fortunately that means we are not violating any distribution rights because those files are not available publicly, only to users that have obtained a license.

**NOTE**: If the software also requires a license, the users will still need to obtain that from the vendors.
