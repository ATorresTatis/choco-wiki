#Creating Chocolatey Packages

There are four main elements to a chocolatey package.  
  
1. nuspec
1. nuget blocker with chocolatey note
1. [[chocolateyInstall.ps1|ChocolateyInstallPS1]]
1. any tools to include (it is highly suggested that you are the author in this case or you have the right to [[distribute rights|Legal]]). EXE files will get a link to the command line.
