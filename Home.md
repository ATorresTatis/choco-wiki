##chocolatey?
Chocolatey is a global automation tool that makes use of PowerShell and the NuGet infrastructure to allow you to do virtually anything. It is kind of like apt-get, but for Windows (with windows comes limitations).

But chocolatey is not just for .NET tools. It's for nearly any windows application/tool!
