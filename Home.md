###What is chocolatey?  
Chocolatey is like apt-get, but for Windows (with windows comes limitations). It is a machine level package manager that is built on top of nuget command line and the nuget infrastructure.  
[[More behind the name|History]]

"Okay, machine package manager, that's nice. What does that mean though?" It means you can simply install software with a few keystrokes and go get coffee while your co-workers are downloading and running an install manually (and I do mean something like an MSI).  
  
How about updates? Wouldn't it be nice to update nearly everything on your machine with a few simple keystrokes? We think so, too.  Chocolatey does that.  
  
###How is chocolatey different than NuGet and/or OpenWrap?
Chocolatey is a machine package manager. Where NuGet/OW are focused on developer library packages, chocolatey is focused on applications and tools, and not necessarily developer focused.
  
###Is there something I can watch to show me this?
There is! This is a long video due to slow internet connections, but watch the first 1:30ish minutes and the last 1:30ish minutes and that will give you a general idea.
