## Default Chocolatey Installation
  
Lots of people tend to ask why the system root for an installation of chocolatey and why not Program Files or the User Path (C:\Users\username or C:\Documents and Settings\username).  
  
That's a great question. Let's get into use cases for chocolatey first.  
  
## Low Privilege Install and Use
Chocolatey should be able to be installed on a machine where the user does not have administrative rights.  A user with non-administrative access should be able to install (through one of the methods, possibly not the default) chocolatey and use it to install tools (non-administrative chocolatey packages) on their system.
