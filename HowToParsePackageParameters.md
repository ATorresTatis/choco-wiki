When installing a Chocolatey Package, it is possible to use a number of arguments to control how the package is installed.  Each one of these arguments is detailed [here](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall).  This _How-To_ focuses on how a package creator can make use of the PackageParameters argument within their package, and how they can parse the string which is passed through into their package from the installation command.

Let's use the following code snippet as the basis of this _How-To_
A complete example of how you **could** do this is shown here:

```powershell

$arguments = @{};

# Let's assume that the input string is something like this, and we will use a Regular Expression to parse the values
# /Port:81 /Edition:LicenseKey

# Now, we can use the $env:chocolateyPackageParameters inside the Chocolatey package
$packageParameters = $env:chocolateyPackageParameters;

# Default the values
$port = "81";
$edition = "LicenseKey";

# Now, letâ€™s parse the packageParameters using good old regular expression
if($packageParameters) {
    $MATCH_PATTERN = "/([a-zA-Z]+):([`"'])?([a-zA-Z0-9- _]+)([`"'])?"
    $PARAMATER_NAME_INDEX = 1
    $VALUE_INDEX = 3
    
    if($packageParameters -match $MATCH_PATTERN ){
        $results = $packageParameters | Select-String $MATCH_PATTERN -AllMatches 
        $results.matches | % { 
          $arguments.Add(
              $_.Groups[$PARAMATER_NAME_INDEX].Value.Trim(),
              $_.Groups[$VALUE_INDEX].Value.Trim()) 
      }
    }     
    
    if($arguments.ContainsKey("Port")) {
        Write-Host "Port Argument Found";
        $port = $arguments["Port"];
    }  
    
    if($arguments.ContainsKey("Edition")) {
        Write-Host "Edition Argument Found";
        $edition = $arguments["Edition"];
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "No Package Parameters Passed in";
}

$silentArgs = "/S /Port=" + $port + " /Edition=" + $edition;

Write-Host "This would be the Chocolatey Silent Arguments: $silentArgs"
```

Now, in this example, if we were to call:

```choco install <packageName>```

The output would be:

```
This would be the Chocolatey Silent Arguments: /S /Port=81 /Edition=LicenseKey
```

i.e. it is using the default values which we made at the top of the file

However, if we instead used:

```
choco install <packageName> -packageParameters "/Port:82 /Edition=LicenseKey1"
```

The output would be:

```
This would be the Chocolatey Silent Arguments: /S /Port=82 /Edition=LicenseKey1
```
