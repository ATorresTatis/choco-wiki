# Download Command (choco download)

Package Internalizer

[Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) starting at licensed version 1.5.0.

Downloads a package from a source, optionally downloading remote
 resources and recompiling the package to use internal resources. This
 takes an existing package and makes it available without any internet
 requirement.

Package Copy / Package Downloader
[Chocolatey Professional](https://chocolatey.org/compare) and up starting in version 1.7.1.

## Usage

    choco download <pkg> [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco download sysinternals

    #### [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) only
    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize
    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location \\server\share
    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location http://somewhere/internal --append-useoriginallocation

## See It In Action

Coming soon

## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [[default options/switches|CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches]] (included below for completeness).
