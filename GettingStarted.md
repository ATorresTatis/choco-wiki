# Getting Started
Now that you have chocolatey on your machine, you can run several commands.

Take a look at the [[command reference|CommandsReference]]. We are going to be using the [[install command|CommandsInstall]].  

Let's install [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

1. Open a command line.
1. Type `cinst notepadplusplus` and press Enter.
1. If you have UAC turned on or are not an administrator, at some chocolatey is going to request administrative permission at some point (at least once during the process). Otherwise it will not be able to finish what it is doing successfully. If you don't have UAC turned on, it will just continue on without stopping to bother you. 
1. That's it. Pretty simple but powerful little concept!
