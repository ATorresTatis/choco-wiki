# Package Maintainer Handover

When a package maintainer is deemed no longer maintaining a package, a new maintainer or maintainers can assist and/or takeover. 

This is done through the Package Triage Process.

An admin will make you a maintainer, you will need to click on the link in your email to confirm.

Once that is done.
