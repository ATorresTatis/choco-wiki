#Command Reference

This is a listing of all of the different things you can pass to chocolatey.

**NOTE:** When you need to quote things, such as when using spaces, please use single quote marks (`'`). In cmd.exe, you can also use double double quotes (i.e. `""yo""`). This is due to the hand off to PowerShell - seems to strip off the outer set of quotes.
