#Why Chocolatey?
##What is the purpose of Chocolatey?

How many times do you hear about an awesome tool/application from your friends and want to try it out? How much effort do you go through to set a tool and all of it's requirements up on your machine? Do you realize that all of this manual effort is a pain? It's a pain we are used to. It's something we just do and don't realize we are wasting time doing all of this manual process. And worse when we install applications. Next Next Next Finish.  
  
There is a better way. Once you start to use Chocolatey to silently install applications, tools, and to quickly set up things on your machine, you will start to realize that it is more of a global automation tool. That makes it an enabler, enabling you to do just about anything. And to repeat it anywhere in the world with little more than an internet connection.  
  
Because Chocolatey is built on top of the NuGet infrastructure, that means you can install packages from NuGet.org, from custom feeds and from private feeds. That means you can set up your own server (even private) and your own internal packages with more company specific packages.
