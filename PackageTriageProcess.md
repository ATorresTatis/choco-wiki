# Package Questions/Updates/Fixes - Triage Process

If you have a question about a package itself, use the contact form on the package page on chocolatey.org to contact the maintainers. From there you usually get a response and you can ask where they keep the packages repository so you can send a pull request.

If you don't hear anything within a few days back from them, it's possible they just haven't gotten to your message yet, but it's also possible that something went wrong and they didn't get the email. Use the report abuse link. That goes to the site curators  and we will try to triage the situation.

If you don't hear anything back from the curators within 2 days (usually same day response), then you send a message to the chocolatey google group (http://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey) and we work to contact the maintainers.

If we don't hear anything back from the package maintainer within a reasonable timeframe, we start a TOS and start adding new folks to the package as maintainers. We don't have non-maintainer uploads in the choco/nuget infrastructure and we haven't needed them yet.
