## New Packages
New packages are packages that have all versions in unapproved status. There are packages out there that were pre-existing before moderation was turned on. Those will have some versions (not prereleases) that are exempted. Prereleases are always exempted.

New packages must meet the requirements above and the following additional requirements.

### Requirements
- check package name - flag if first version based on the naming convention (doesn't matter if prerelease or not)
- suggest the name split if over 25 chars with no -
- flag on "."" in name (unless .portable/.install)
- not a package duplicating another existing package
